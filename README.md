#Capstone Project: Data Science for a Private Space Launch Company
Project Overview
This capstone project applies data science skills to a real-world scenario in the private space launch industry. The goal is to collect, process, and analyze datasets to gain insights and build predictive models, ultimately creating a compelling presentation to tell the story of the analysis.

Project Objectives
Collect data from various sources and perform data wrangling to improve quality
Explore processed data using SQL, statistical analysis, and data visualization
Apply data visualization techniques to identify relationships between variables
Split data into groups and drill down into finer levels of detail using categorical variables
Build, evaluate, and refine predictive models to discover new insights
Create a presentation summarizing the analysis and key findings
Project Scope
This project involves the following steps:

Data Collection
Data Wrangling
Data Exploration (SQL, statistical analysis, data visualization)
Data Analysis (grouping, filtering, and visualization)
Predictive Modeling
Presentation Development
Deliverables
The final deliverable is a presentation summarizing the analysis and key findings, developed into a narrative story.
